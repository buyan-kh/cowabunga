# Solo Developer Strategy for Cowabunga

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Start Small, Think Big

As a solo developer, you need to be strategic about what you build first. The key is to create a working prototype that demonstrates the core value proposition, then iterate rapidly.

## üìã Phase-by-Phase Solo Development Strategy

### Phase 0: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Get basic development environment running

#### Step 1: VSCode Fork Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone VSCode
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vscode.git cowabunga-vscode
cd cowabunga-vscode

# Create your development branch
git checkout -b feature/canvas-foundation

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Cursor Configuration

- Use the rules we created to guide Cursor's assistance
- Create specific prompts for common tasks
- Set up workspace with proper TypeScript configuration

#### Step 3: Development Environment

```bash
# Create your custom extension structure
mkdir -p extensions/cowabunga-canvas
mkdir -p src/vs/cowabunga

# Set up build system for your additions
npm run watch  # Keep this running during development
```

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Canvas (Week 3-6)

**Goal**: Basic infinite canvas that can display code files

#### Priority 1: Canvas Infrastructure

**Cursor Prompt Strategy**: Break into micro-tasks

```
"Help me create a basic HTML5 canvas that can:
1. Handle mouse wheel zoom
2. Pan with mouse drag
3. Render a simple rectangle representing a code file
4. Maintain 60fps performance"
```

#### Priority 2: File Integration

**Cursor Prompt Strategy**: Leverage existing VSCode APIs

```
"Show me how to:
1. Get the current active editor content
2. Render it in a canvas-based window
3. Maintain syntax highlighting
4. Handle file changes in real-time"
```

#### Priority 3: Basic Navigation

**Cursor Prompt Strategy**: Focus on core UX

```
"Help me implement:
1. Double-click to open files on canvas
2. Zoom to fit functionality
3. Basic minimap for navigation
4. Keyboard shortcuts for zoom/pan"
```

### Phase 2: Visual Connections (Week 7-10)

**Goal**: Show relationships between functions/files

#### Priority 1: AST Analysis

**Cursor Prompt Strategy**: Use existing tools

```
"Help me integrate TypeScript compiler API to:
1. Parse function declarations
2. Find function calls
3. Create a graph of relationships
4. Update when files change"
```

#### Priority 2: Connection Visualization

**Cursor Prompt Strategy**: Simple line drawing

```
"Show me how to:
1. Draw lines between canvas elements
2. Make lines interactive (hover, click)
3. Style different types of connections
4. Animate connection updates"
```

### Phase 3: Smart Layout (Week 11-14)

**Goal**: Automatic and manual arrangement

#### Priority 1: Auto-Layout Algorithm

**Cursor Prompt Strategy**: Use existing algorithms

```
"Help me implement a force-directed layout algorithm for:
1. Positioning code files based on relationships
2. Avoiding overlaps
3. Maintaining readable distances
4. Animating layout changes"
```

## üöÄ Cursor Optimization Strategies

### 1. Prompt Engineering for Complex Tasks

Instead of asking for entire features, break down into specific, actionable prompts:

**‚ùå Bad**: "Build an infinite canvas for VSCode"
**‚úÖ Good**: "Help me create a TypeScript class that handles mouse wheel events to zoom a canvas element while maintaining aspect ratio"

### 2. Leverage Cursor's Codebase Understanding

Use Cursor's ability to understand your existing code:

```
"Looking at my current canvas implementation in src/vs/cowabunga/canvas/,
help me add a method to convert screen coordinates to canvas coordinates
that accounts for current zoom and pan state"
```

### 3. Iterative Development with Cursor

Build in small increments:

```
"I have a basic canvas. Now help me add:
1. A simple rectangle that represents a file
2. Text rendering inside the rectangle
3. Click handling for the rectangle
4. Hover effects"
```

### 4. Use Cursor for Debugging

When things break, provide context:

```
"My canvas is flickering when I zoom. Here's my render loop code: [paste code]
The issue seems to happen when zoom level changes rapidly. Help me identify the problem."
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow Optimization

### Daily Development Routine

1. **Morning**: Review yesterday's progress, plan 2-3 small tasks
2. **Focus Time**: 2-3 hour blocks of deep coding with Cursor
3. **Testing**: Quick manual tests after each feature
4. **Evening**: Document progress, plan tomorrow

### Cursor Usage Patterns

- **Feature Development**: 70% of time with Cursor assistance
- **Debugging**: 20% of time with Cursor helping diagnose issues
- **Architecture**: 10% of time planning with Cursor's input

### Code Organization Strategy

```
src/vs/cowabunga/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ canvas/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CanvasEngine.ts      # Core canvas functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ViewportManager.ts   # Zoom/pan handling
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RenderLoop.ts        # Performance-optimized rendering
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ visual/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CodeWindow.ts        # Individual code file display
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ConnectionLine.ts    # Visual connections
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LayoutManager.ts     # Auto-layout algorithms
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VSCodeBridge.ts      # Interface with VSCode APIs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EditorSync.ts        # Keep canvas in sync with editor
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CowabunaTypes.ts     # TypeScript definitions
```

## üéØ Specific Cursor Prompts for Common Tasks

### Setting Up New Features

```
"Help me create a new TypeScript class for [feature] that:
1. Follows the existing VSCode patterns in src/vs/
2. Has proper dependency injection
3. Includes error handling
4. Has TypeScript types defined
5. Follows the Cowabunga architecture from our rules"
```

### Performance Optimization

```
"My canvas is slow when displaying 100+ files. Help me:
1. Implement viewport culling (only render visible items)
2. Use object pooling for frequently created objects
3. Optimize the render loop
4. Add performance monitoring"
```

### Integration with VSCode

```
"Show me how to:
1. Listen for file changes in VSCode
2. Update my canvas when files are modified
3. Sync selection between canvas and editor
4. Respect VSCode themes and settings"
```

### Testing and Debugging

```
"Help me create:
1. Unit tests for my canvas engine
2. Integration tests for VSCode interaction
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Error handling for edge cases"
```

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Scope Creep

**Problem**: Trying to implement too many features at once
**Solution**: Stick to the minimal viable feature set

### 2. Over-Engineering

**Problem**: Building complex abstractions too early
**Solution**: Start simple, refactor when needed

### 3. Perfection Paralysis

**Problem**: Spending too long on one feature
**Solution**: Set time limits, move on to next feature

### 4. Ignoring Performance

**Problem**: Building features without considering performance
**Solution**: Profile regularly, optimize incrementally

## üèÜ Long-term Strategy

### Months 1-3: Core MVP

Build the essential features that demonstrate the value proposition

### Months 4-6: Community Building

Share progress, get feedback, build early adopter community

### Months 7-9: Feature Expansion

Add advanced features based on user feedback

### Months 10-12: Enterprise Readiness

Polish, security, performance, documentation

## üí° Pro Tips for Solo Development

1. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank present you
2. **Test Early and Often**: Catch bugs when they're easy to fix
3. **Stay Motivated**: Celebrate small wins, share progress
4. **Get Feedback**: Show your work to other developers regularly
5. **Manage Burnout**: Take breaks, vary your tasks

Remember: The goal is not to build everything perfectly, but to build something valuable that works. Start with the smallest possible demo that shows the core value, then iterate rapidly based on feedback.
